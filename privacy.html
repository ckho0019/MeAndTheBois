          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">When migrating to the cloud, a trade-off we're making is having to transfer chunks of our personal data in order to satisfy compliance needs. Although this is very manageable, it is for certain that our highly sensitive data will be at risk during the migration. After thorough evaluation of this trade-off, we've come to agreement that migrating to the cloud is an arguably good decision. These days many public cloud providers offer resoures for threat protection which enables data encryption and  leaves us with no choice but to give them the benefit of the doubt in regards to our personal data being at risk.</h5>

        <div class="card text-white bg-primary mb-3" style="max-width: 80rem;">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">In terms of security, yes it is worth it to set up your own private cloud services as the data will be trafficked and handled under your home network which means any shifting of your data will be under your supervision. In terms of cost, it is also worth it as it will be lower continual cost.  Only initial payment is for the licensing, servers and space required. Any future upgrade costs will then depend on you.</h5>

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">No, we believe that we don't have the moral standing to complain in regards to encroachment of our privacy as we have agreed to give out personal information in exchange for convenience when utilizing third party services. In the case of it being a conscious decision, it is only fair and ethical that we do not put the blame on these services when there's a breach of privacy as we have placed our data at risk in the first place.</h5>
