            <h4>First and foremost, an ethical issue that may arise in regards to this situation is the disruption of confidentiality. Although it is stated that all data will be handled by the organisation running the self hosted cloud, this might clash with the ACM code of ethics [1.7 Honor confidentiality] as the head of the organisation has complete control over their staff's data, for example and it is understood that computer professionals should only use confidential information entrusted to them when facing appropriate authorities.</h4>
            <br>
            <h4>Another possible ethical issue is performing work out of your area of expertise. Although learning to self host your own cloud is very beneficial, it mildly goes against the ACM code of ethics [2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence]. The computing professional might or might not be fond of this field and if he/she isn't, there is a huge risk of a breaching of personal data whilst in the process of doing this. And if that data is put into the wrong hands, problems such as having to pay ransom in order to retrieve your data back might arise.</h4>
            <br>
            <h4>Nonetheless, it might go against the ACM code of ethics [3.6 Use care when modifying or retiring systems]. The freedom of having such flexibility in upgrading storage size and processor speed could lead to impractical decisions that brings forth risks which might lead to a declination in the quality of work. So, upgrades should ONLY be done after thorough research and investigation for viable alternatives.</h4>
